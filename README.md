Here’s a clear roadmap to help you explore the *DBeaver* codebase (hosted on GitHub) and guide you in creating your own Eclipse RCP application with a similar structure and user interface.

---

## 🧱 1. DBeaver Code Structure & Architecture

### High‑Level Architecture

* DBeaver is built on *Eclipse RCP (Rich Client Platform)* using a modular *OSGi plugin architecture*. Its core is organized as plugins (bundles), grouped into features and products ([DeepWiki][1]).
* Key systems include: the *Core plugin system, **Data Source Management, **Database Support extensions, **SQL editor system, **UI framework and tools* ([DeepWiki][2]).

### Codebase Structure

* There are directories like:

  * plugins/ for OSGi bundles such as org.jkiss.dbeaver.core, model, UI editors, and database extension plugins.
  * features/ defining collections of plugins (e.g., runtime, RCP-specific).
  * product/ for full application build configurations like Community or Enterprise editions ([DeepWiki][3], [GitHub][4]).

### Build System

* DBeaver uses *Maven with Tycho* to build Eclipse plugins, features, and products.
* Build profiles support different platform targets (Windows, macOS, Linux, ARM64, etc.) ([DeepWiki][3]).

### Major Subsystems

* *SQL Editor*: divided into SQLEditorBase (syntax highlighting, completion) and SQLEditor (query execution, result tabs), interacting with SQLCompletionContext, SQLQueryJob, ResultSetViewer, and database dialect abstractions ([DeepWiki][5]).
* *Data Source Management*: manages connections via interfaces like DBPDataSourceContainer, DBPDataSourceRegistry, and platform workspace services (DBPPlatform) ([DeepWiki][1]).

Step 1: Install Required Plugins


Install Maven Integration for Eclipse (m2e):

Open Eclipse and go to Help > Eclipse Marketplace....
Search for "Maven Integration for Eclipse" and install it.



Install Tycho Plugins:

Tycho plugins are typically used via the command line, but you can ensure Maven integration is properly set up in Eclipse to handle Tycho builds.



Step 2: Create a New Maven Project

Create a Parent Project:

Go to File > New > Project....
Select Maven > Maven Project and click Next.
Check Create a simple project and click Next.
Enter Group ID (e.g., com.example), Artifact ID (e.g., my-rcp-application), and Version (e.g., 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT).
Set Packaging to pom.
Click Finish.



Step 3: Configure the Parent POM

Open the pom.xml file of the parent project.
Edit the POM to include the modules and Tycho configuration as described in the previous response.

Step 4: Create Modules


Create Plugin Module:

Right-click on the parent project and select New > Project....
Select Maven > Maven Module and click Next.
Enter myplugin as the module name and click Finish.
Open the pom.xml of the plugin module and set the packaging to eclipse-plugin.



Create Feature Module:

Repeat the process to create a new Maven module named myfeature.
Set the packaging to eclipse-feature in its pom.xml.



Create Product Module:

Repeat the process to create a new Maven module named myproduct.
Set the packaging to eclipse-repository in its pom.xml.



Step 5: Create Additional Files


Create feature.xml for the Feature Module:

Right-click on the myfeature module and select New > File.
Name the file feature.xml and create it with the content as described earlier.



Create .product File for the Product Module:

Right-click on the myproduct module and select New > File.
Name the file myproduct.product and create it with the content as described earlier.



Step 6: Build the Project

Run Maven Build:

Right-click on the parent project and select Run As > Maven build....
In the Goals field, enter clean install and click Run.



Step 7: Verify the Build

Check the target directory of each module to ensure the build artifacts are generated correctly.

Additional Tips

Eclipse PDE (Plugin Development Environment): If you plan to develop Eclipse plugins extensively, consider using Eclipse PDE tools, which provide specialized support for developing Eclipse plugins and RCP applications.
Target Platform: Ensure your target platform is correctly set up in Eclipse to match the dependencies specified in your POM files.

By following these steps, you can set up and build an Eclipse RCP application using Maven and Tycho within the Eclipse IDE's graphical interface.

**User**

can you explain this code 




---

**Cursor**

Certainly! This code defines a custom dialog window for a UI test in an Eclipse RCP (Rich Client Platform) application, likely as part of the DBeaver project. Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening:

---

### 1. **Class Declaration**
```java
public class TestDialog extends TrayDialog
```
- `TestDialog` is a class that extends `TrayDialog`, which is a standard dialog class in Eclipse SWT/JFace for creating dialogs with a tray area.

---

### 2. **Fields**
```java
private FolderComposite folderComposite;
private final FolderInfo[] tabs;
```
- `folderComposite`: A custom composite widget that will display tabbed pages.
- `tabs`: An array of `FolderInfo` objects, each representing a tab in the dialog.

---

### 3. **Constructor**
```java
public TestDialog(Shell shell)
```
- The constructor initializes the dialog with a parent `Shell`.
- It creates three `FolderInfo` objects, each representing a tab:
  - **Tab 1**: Has a simple `Text` field.
  - **Tab 2**: Has a `Label`.
  - **Tab 3**: Has a multi-line `Text` field (with scrollbars).
- Each tab is given an ID, a label, an icon (`DBIcon`), a tooltip, and a `FolderPage` (which defines the content for the tab).

---

### 4. **isResizable()**
```java
@Override
protected boolean isResizable() {
    return true;
}
```
- This makes the dialog window resizable by the user.

---

### 5. **createDialogArea()**
```java
@Override
protected Control createDialogArea(Composite parent)
```
- This method creates the main content area of the dialog.
- Sets the dialog title to "Test".
- Creates a `Composite` (container) for the dialog’s content.
- Sets layout data to make the dialog fill available space.
- Creates a `FolderComposite` (the tabbed area) inside the group, with left-aligned, multi-tab support.
- Sets the size hints for the tab area (300x300 pixels).
- Assigns the previously created `tabs` to the `FolderComposite`, so the tabs/pages appear in the dialog.

---

### 6. **FolderInfo and FolderPage**
- `FolderInfo` is a data structure representing a tab: its ID, label, icon, tooltip, and content.
- `FolderPage` is an interface (or abstract class) with a `createControl` method, which is implemented here as an anonymous class for each tab to define what UI controls appear on that tab.

---

## **Summary**
- This dialog creates a window with three tabs, each with different content (a text field, a label, and a multi-line text field).
- It uses custom DBeaver UI components (`FolderComposite`, `FolderInfo`, `FolderPage`) to manage the tabs.
- The dialog is resizable and has a fixed size hint for the tab area.

---

**If you want more details about any specific part (like how FolderComposite works), let me know!**

```java
public class TestDialog extends TrayDialog
```

```java
private FolderComposite folderComposite;
private final FolderInfo[] tabs;
```

```java
public TestDialog(Shell shell)
```

```java
@Override
protected boolean isResizable() {
    return true;
}
```

```java
@Override
protected Control createDialogArea(Composite parent)
```

**User**

hey chat in the plugin dbeaver-3.5.2 I want to understand the architecture of the project 

root of the repository is a maven project and inside the plugins they are plug-in Project from the eclipse RCP and the other files ?? ?? can explain the architecture and how to create something like this 

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Let’s break down the architecture of the DBeaver project (as seen in your `dbeaver-3.5.2` directory) and explain how it’s structured, why it’s set up this way, and how you could create something similar.

---

## 1. **High-Level Architecture**

### **a. Root Maven Project**
- The root directory contains a `pom.xml` file, making it a **Maven multi-module project**.
- Maven is used for dependency management, building, and packaging the entire application and its submodules.

### **b. Eclipse RCP (Rich Client Platform)**
- DBeaver is built on top of Eclipse RCP, which is a platform for building modular, extensible desktop applications in Java.
- RCP applications are composed of **plug-ins** (also called bundles), each with its own code, resources, and configuration.

### **c. Plugins Directory**
- The `plugins/` directory contains many subdirectories, each representing a separate Eclipse plug-in (bundle).
- Each plug-in has its own `MANIFEST.MF`, `plugin.xml`, and sometimes a `pom.xml` for Maven integration.

### **d. Features Directory**
- The `features/` directory contains Eclipse **feature projects**. A feature is a collection of plug-ins that can be installed together.
- Features are used to group related plug-ins for distribution and update sites.

### **e. Modules Directory**
- The `modules/` directory contains utility libraries or shared code that may not be full Eclipse plug-ins but are used by them.

### **f. Product Directory**
- The `product/` directory contains product definitions, branding, and launch configurations for building the final application.

---

## 2. **Key Files and Their Roles**

- **pom.xml (root):** Declares the overall project and its modules.
- **plugins/org.jkiss.dbeaver.core/**: The main plug-in for DBeaver’s core functionality.
- **plugins/org.jkiss.dbeaver.ext.*:** Extension plug-ins for databases, features, etc.
- **features/org.jkiss.dbeaver.core.feature/**: Groups core plug-ins for packaging.
- **META-INF/MANIFEST.MF:** OSGi manifest file describing the plug-in’s dependencies and metadata.
- **plugin.xml:** Eclipse-specific configuration for extension points, UI contributions, etc.
- **build.properties:** Tells Eclipse what to include in the build.

---

## 3. **How the Pieces Work Together**

- **Maven** builds all modules, resolves dependencies, and can package the application.
- **Eclipse RCP** provides the runtime, UI framework, and plug-in system.
- **Plug-ins** encapsulate features, can depend on each other, and are loaded by the OSGi runtime.
- **Features** group plug-ins for installation/update.
- **Product** definitions describe how to assemble and launch the final application.

---

## 4. **How to Create a Similar Architecture**

### **Step 1: Set Up a Maven Multi-Module Project**
- Create a root directory with a `pom.xml` that lists modules (plug-ins, features, etc.).

### **Step 2: Create Eclipse Plug-in Projects**
- Use Eclipse IDE: `File > New > Project... > Plug-in Project`.
- Each plug-in gets its own directory, `MANIFEST.MF`, `plugin.xml`, and optionally a `pom.xml`.

### **Step 3: Create Feature Projects**
- In Eclipse: `File > New > Project... > Feature Project`.
- Add your plug-ins to the feature.

### **Step 4: Create a Product Definition**
- In Eclipse: `File > New > Other... > Product Configuration`.
- Define branding, splash screen, and which features/plug-ins are included.

### **Step 5: Build and Run**
- Use Maven (`mvn clean install`) to build everything.
- Use Eclipse’s “Export Product” wizard or Tycho Maven plugin to package the RCP application.

---

## 5. **Why This Architecture?**

- **Modularity:** Each feature or database extension is a separate plug-in, making it easy to add/remove functionality.
- **Extensibility:** New features can be added as new plug-ins without modifying the core.
- **Maintainability:** Code is organized by feature, making it easier to manage.
- **Distribution:** Features and products make it easy to distribute different versions or editions.

---

## 6. **Other Files/Directories**

- **docs/**: Documentation, developer guides, licenses.
- **obsolete/**: Old or deprecated plug-ins/features.
- **bin/**: Compiled classes (if not using Maven for builds).
- **css/, icons/**: UI resources.
